# SegFormer-with-PytorchLightning

In this project, I provide an example of training the SegFormer model for image segmentation using Pytorch Lightning and Albumentations. 
The project includes a Jupyter notebook example of using the trained model for inference, 
as well as some sample results from the model after 20 epochs of training. We hope that this project serves as a useful resource for those interested in implementing the SegFormer model and using Pytorch Lightning for deep learning tasks.

Results of a model trained 10 epochs on 600 images dataset.
